The groundwater level time series originate from the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment (LfU) and are publicly accessible on the water information platform of the State of Brandenburg (https://apw.brandenburg.de/#). They cover the period from January 1, 1990 to December 28, 2020 and were processed as follows: Aggregation on a weekly basis (Monday), linear interpolation for measurement gaps of up to four weeks, imputation of larger gaps (up to 52 weeks) using an iterative imputer based on “Bayesian Ridge” from “scikit-learn” (Pedregosa et al., 2011). The original monitoring well names of this 100 monitoring sites were replaced by anonymized IDs from 1-100.
The total of 100 selected groundwater level time series, consisting of 50 stationary and 50 non-stationary time series (tested with Augmented Dickey-Fuller-Unit-Root-Test (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin-Tests (KPSS) of the Python module “statsmodels” (Seabold and Perktold, 2010) on default settings). A time series was only classified as stationary if both tests confirmed stationarity. Otherwise, it was classified as non-stationary. The time series 1-50 were classified as stationary, the time series 51-100 as non-stationary (see file ids_wells.csv). By selecting an equal number of stationary and non-stationary groundwater level time series, it is ensured that the data set contains time series with constant mean values and variances as well as time series with constant mean values and variances.
